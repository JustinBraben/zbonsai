Inspired by [cbonsai](https://gitlab.com/jallbrit/cbonsai), zbonsai is a Zig-based terminal application that procedurally generates beautiful bonsai trees in your command line interface. zbonsai brings the zen of bonsai to your terminal, reimagined in the Zig programming language.

## Features

- Procedurally generated bonsai trees
- Customizable tree parameters
- Terminal-based user interface using libvaxis
- Command-line argument parsing with zig-clap

## Installation

To install zbonsai, you'll need to have Zig `0.13.0` on your system. Then, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/JustinBraben/zbonsai.git
   cd zbonsai
   ```

2. Build the project:
   ```
   zig build

zig build run -- -l
```

Generate tree live with verbose output.

```
zig build run -- -l -v minimal
```
